# Ecommerce-Customers

📌 Project Overview
In this project, I take the role of a data scientist at an e-commerce company that sells clothing online and offers in-store styling sessions. After receiving style advice in store, customers can place orders through either a mobile app or a website.

The business is currently deciding where to invest more: improving the mobile app or enhancing the website. To help with this decision, I conducted a full analysis of customer behavior, focusing on annual spending trends and feature importance.
